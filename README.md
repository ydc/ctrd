# Introduction
CTRD is a new Chinese Theme-Rheme Discourse Dataset for Chinese discourse analysis, which contains 525 manually annotated news articles, i.e. totally 45,591 sentences, extracted from OntoNotes 4.0. Different from Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) and the datasets based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), CTRD was annotated according to a novel discourse annotation scheme for Chinese based on Halliday’s Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) and Thematic Progression Patterns (TPP).
